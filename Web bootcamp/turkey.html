    <h2>Name</h2>
    <p>
      The English name of Turkey (from Medieval Latin Turchia/Turquia[30]) means
      "land of the Turks". Middle English usage of Turkye is evidenced in an
      early work by Chaucer called The B ook of the Duchess (c.1369). The phrase
      land of Torke is used in the 15th-century Digby Mysteries. Later usages
      can be found in the Dunbar poems, the 16th century Manipulus Vocabulorum
      (Turkie) and Francis Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum (Turky). The modern spelling
      Turkey dates back to at least 1719.[31] The name of Turkey appeared in the
      Western sources after the crusades.[32] In the 14th-century Arab sources,
      turkiyya is usually contrasted with turkmaniyya (Turkomania), probably to
      be understood as Oghuz in a broad sense.[33] Ibn Battuta, in the 1330s
      introduces the region as barr al-Turkiyya al-ma'ruf bi-bilad al-Rum ("the
      Turkish land known as the lands of Rum").[34] The disintegration of the
      country after World War I revived Turkish nationalism, and the Türkler
      için Türkiye ("Turkey for the Turks") sentiment rose up. With the Treaty
      of Alexandropol signed by the Government of the Grand National Assembly
      with Armenia, the name of Türkiye entered international documents for the
      first time. In the treaty signed with Afghanistan, the expression Devlet-i
      Aliyye-i Türkiyye ("Sublime Turkish State") was used, likened to the
      Ottoman Empire's name.[32]

      In January 2020, the Turkish Exporters' Assembly (TİM) — the umbrella
      organisation of Turkish exports — announced that it would use "Made in
      Turkiye" on all its labels in a bid to standardise branding and the
      identity of Turkish businesses on the international stage, using the term
      'Turkiye' across all languages around the world.[35] In December 2021,
      President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan issued a circular calling for exports to be
      labelled "Made in Türkiye". The circular also stated that in relation to
      other governmental communications "necessary sensitivity will be shown on
      the use of the phrase 'Türkiye' instead of phrases such as 'Turkey',
      'Türkei', 'Turquie' etc."[36][37] The reason given in the circular for
      preferring Türkiye was that it "represents and expresses the culture,
      civilisation, and values of the Turkish nation in the best way". According
      to Turkish state broadcaster TRT World, it was also to avoid a pejorative
      association with turkey, the bird.[35] It was reported in January 2022
      that the government planned to register Türkiye with the United
      Nations.[38] Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu sent letters to
      the UN and other international organisations on 31 May 2022 requesting
      that they use Türkiye. The UN agreed and implemented the request
      immediately.[39][40]
